## Overview



This simple Shiny app demonstrates the leverage and influence of an adjustable point that is part of a dataset with 101 points. 100 of the points are normally distributed and fixed. The extra point is adjustable and its X-Y coordinates can be selected using sliders with ranges [-10,10]. The adjustable point appears in red on the graph.

The application is deployed on [ShinyApp.io](https://omaymas.shinyapps.io/Influence_Analysis/)
